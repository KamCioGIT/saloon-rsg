## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Staff List Not Showing / Invisible Employees
- Ensure you have executed the `installation/saloon_premium.sql` file to create the `saloon_premium_employees` table.
- If an employee is hired but doesn't appear immediately, the scripts now force a database save, but a resource restart can also clear up desync issues.
- Check server console for `[Saloon]` debug prints if `Config.Debug = true`.
